# 5th Task: Network Packet Analyzer Program

As part of my final assignment during the internship at Prodigy InfoTech, I developed a Network Packet Analyzer using Python. This project highlights essential skills in capturing and analyzing network traffic, emphasizing the importance of ethical practices in network monitoring.

## Overview

The Network Packet Analyzer captures and analyzes network packets in real-time, providing detailed information such as source and destination IP addresses, protocols, and payload data. This tool serves as a practical example of network traffic analysis while prioritizing ethical use for educational purposes.

## Features

- **Real-Time Traffic Analysis:** Monitors and captures network packets in real-time.
- **Detailed Packet Information:** Displays crucial details like source and destination IP addresses, protocols, and payload data.
- **TCP/UDP Payload Inspection:** Decodes and inspects the payloads of TCP and UDP packets.
- **Ethical Focus:** Ensures ethical usage and educational intent, highlighting the importance of privacy and legal considerations.

  ## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Scapy library

## Ethical Considerations

Always ensure you have explicit permission to monitor network traffic and adhere to ethical guidelines when using or developing packet sniffers to respect privacy and legal boundaries.
